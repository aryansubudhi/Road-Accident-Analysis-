# Road_Accident_Analysis(Interactive Dashboard using MS Excel)
## Project Objective
  Created an Excel-based dashboard to examine traffic accidents in 2021 and 2022, including statistics on casualties, trends, and accident-causing variables

##Question (KPIs)
1. fatalities and their proportion according to the kind of vehicle and accident severity.
2. Vehicle type-specific casualties.
3. patterns in monthly casualties to compare the two years.
4. Maximum Casualties by Road type.
5. Casualty distribution by surface of the road.
6. Relationships between Casualties by Day/Night and by Area/Location.

##Steps Followed: -
Here's my approach to the project:
1. Data Cleaning: - Eliminated mistakes, duplication, and inconsistencies to guarantee correct data.
2. Data Processing: New columns were made to arrange the data and provide insights.
3. Data Analysis: Utilized statistical techniques to glean insightful information.
4. Data Visualization: I was able to construct interactive charts and graphs using Excel as my visualization tool.
5. Dashboard Creation: To facilitate user engagement, an Excel dashboard with timelines and slicers was created.

##Key Insights: -
1. Total Casualties that took place after the accident: - 417,883
2. Max Casualties by Car: 333,485 (79.8%); Min by Others: 3,424
3. 2021 & 2022 Casualties: 222,146 & 195,737
4. Peak Casualties: Nov 2021 & Nov 2022; Min: Feb 2021 & Jan 2022
5. Max Casualties: Single Carriageway; Min: Slip Road
6. Most Casualties: Dry Road surfaces
